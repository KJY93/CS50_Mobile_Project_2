### Features Implemented
- Users are able to search for movies by typing their search in the search bar
- Users are able to view additional information about movies they have selected
- Users are able to navigate between the home screen and the movie details screen (Stack Navigator was used for the navigation between different screens)
- For movies with image source uri not working, a default fallback "No Image Available" picture will be used instead

### Getting Started
You will need Expo, Expo Client (download this from Apple App Store so that the app can run on your phone), Node.js and NPM installed. After that, install all the app's dependencies by running the npm install command in your terminal. To start up the app, run the npm start command in your terminal. The Expo interface will then be popped up in a browser. User will then have the option to choose on which platform they would want their app to run on, i.e. Android simulator / iOS simulator / web browser etc. To run the app on your phone, simply scan the QR code and the app will be started in the Expo Client app.
